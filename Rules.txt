The name of the game is Trash

OBJECTIVE:
To get all of your cards flipped over in ascending order of 1 through 8

CARD MEANINGS:
Cards with any letters or any symbol with the numbers 1-8 are accessible and used no matter what
Ace is used as the number 1
The cards with the number or symbol or face of 9, 10, Jack, or Queen will always be trashed because they are not useful
The card King, can act as any card 

THE SETUP:
The dealer distributes a standard pack of 52 cards, shuffled, with each player getting 8 cards in total
Each player arranges their cards in 2 rows of 4 cards, facedown, without looking at them
the top left to top right are numbered 1-4, and the bottom left to bottom right are numbered 5-8
The remaining cards are set in the middle within reach of each person, facedown
The dealer flips one card over faceup, leaving it in the middle
Everytime someone has all of their cards flipped over, they win the round
The person who won that round will get one less card when the cards are redistributed 

ROUND 1:
The player to the left of the dealer can either use that card to substitute one of their cards if it is a number 1-8 or King. 
the card he/she substitutes will be thrown to "Trash" (the middle)
The player to the left of them will go until one person has all of their cards flipped over in ascending order

ROUND 2: 
Everybody is redistributed 8 cards except the winner; He only recieves 7
The player who won the last round will go first
The objective is still to flip over all the cards in ascending order with substitution 

WHEN DOES THE GAME END?
The game ends when one person has won 8 rounds and has no cards remaining
